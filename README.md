# Angular Bug tracker CRUD application using Angular Material.
Created a local JSON server to host data but can easily be linked to mongodb, firebase, sql etc.
In this project, I created an API service to post, put, get and delete data
Using Angular Material Forms and Tables, I was able to add filtering, and many form features. Pagination implemented as well.

One area of improvement is the use of more components to make the project more organized and easy to understand As I was really focused on making it work. I will comeback and refactor code :) Enjoy the demo
