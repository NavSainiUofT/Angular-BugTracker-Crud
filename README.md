# Angular Bug tracker CRUD application using Angular Material.
Created a local JSON server to host data but can easily be linked to mongodb, firebase, sql etc.
In this project, I created an API service to post, put, get and delete data
Using Angular Material Forms and Tables, I was able to add filtering, and many form features. 
One area of improvement is the use of more components to make the project more organized and easy to understand. I will work on this in the future as this project is ongoing.
